  ## Description
  
  - This is my first homework assignment hosting my first server on the internet for the Full Stack Web Developer course I'm enrolled in. 
  - The homework assignment was to modify front end started code for an application that lets a user write, save and delete personal notes. In order for the application to work correctly, it was my job to build the back end, connect the front end, and deploy the entire application to Heroku.
  - By completing this assignment, I was able to implement lessons from my course, including: Use an Express.js back end, Implement a modular router in my code to respond to client requests, Use FS.js to create, append and delete files, and finally create a simple database for data persistence.

  
  The following is a screenshot of the final version of webpage hosted on Heroku.
