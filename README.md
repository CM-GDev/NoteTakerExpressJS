  ## Description
  
  - This is my first homework assignment using Herokut to host my first server for the Full Stack Web Developer course I'm enrolled in. 
  - By completing this assignment, I was able to implement lessons from my course, including: Set Jest.js tests, Code JavaScript for a Node.js application, Establish Classes , Implement several JS modules, work with a CSS framework, Use FS.js to create and append files, and finally apply Inquirer.js for the user interface on the command-line.

  

  The following are screenshots of the final version of the application in the terminal and a sample HTML page generated by the command-line application.
